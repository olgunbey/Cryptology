- It will encrypt the message from Alice with AES according to the diffie hellman key sharing algorithm.
- The text encrypted with AES will be signed with a digital signature and the RSA algorithm will be used.
- First, Bob will check who the message is from with a digital signature, then decrypt it with AES (Not finished)
